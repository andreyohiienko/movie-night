# Fineao take-home test

Published to https://absurd-giraffe.surge.sh

Starting with this endpoint:

https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-popular-movies

Please build a react app that does the following.

Home route ‘/’
Fetch a list of popular movies and display their posters in a list. For each poster that is
rendered create a UI element that allows me to like or unlike that movie. A movie that has been
liked should indicate that visually.

Liked route ‘/liked’
Render the movie posters from the list of Liked movies.

### Navigation
- provide a simple way to move between the two routes
Bonus points:
- don’t put any operation that is non-presentational in a component
### SR dev:
- show me clean code
- show me custom hooks

### JR & Intermediate dev:
- show me a pixel-perfect user interface

Please upload this to your github or email me a zip folder with your content.
